    "## Scientific background \n",
    "\n",
    "The AJILE12 dataset is the largest publicly available human neurobehavioral dataset, recorded during passive clinical epilepsy monitoring. It includes synchronized intracranial neural recordings and upper body pose trajectories across 55 semi-continuous days of naturalistic movements, along with relevant metadata. The dataset was created to understand the neural basis of human movement in naturalistic scenarios and expand neuroscience research beyond constrained laboratory paradigms. It is available on The DANDI Archive in the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) data standard and can be explored using a browser-based dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "For scientific background, see the following papers from [Bing Brunton lab](https://www.bingbrunton.com/bing) who graciously has released the **AJILE12** data on [DANDI](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000055?search=ajile12&pos=1):\n",

AJILE12 includes synchronized intracranial neural recordings and upper body pose trajectories across 55 semi-continuous days of naturalistic movements, along with relevant metadata, including thousands of wrist movement events and annotated behavioral states. Neural recordings are available at 500 Hz from at least 64 electrodes per participant, for a total of 1280 hours. Pose trajectories at 9 upper-body keypoints, including wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints, were sampled at 30 frames per second and estimated from 118 million video frames.\n",
